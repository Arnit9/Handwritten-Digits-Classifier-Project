# Handwritten Digits Classifier using PyTorch 👋

Welcome to the Handwritten Digits Classifier project! In this project, we'll be building a powerful system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten digits using deep learning techniques. Our goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 🖋️🔢

## Project Summary 📜

As a machine learning engineer, I've developed a proof of concept for the OCR system using the MNIST database of handwritten digits. This project showcases the application of deep learning essentials, including feedforward and backward propagation, neural network architecture design, gradient descent, logistic regression, fine-tuning parameters, and PyTorch. The project can be summarized in the following steps:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration 📊

- Transformed the data to make it suitable for input into neural networks.
- Utilized PyTorch's DataLoader to efficiently feed training data to the neural network.
- Explored the MNIST datasets, described their properties, and optimized neural network parameters accordingly.
- Justified preprocessing steps, ensuring that the data is prepared appropriately for training.

### 2. Model Design and Training 🧠

- Constructed a neural network using PyTorch, tailored for image classification.
- Chose an appropriate loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss) for training the classification network.
- Defined an optimizer (e.g., Adam Optimizer) to minimize the loss function and update model parameters for enhanced accuracy.

### 3. Model Testing and Evaluation 🧪

- Employed the DataLoader and a holdout set to rigorously test the model's accuracy.
- Iteratively optimized hyperparameters to achieve the desired level of accuracy.
- Saved trained model parameters for future use and deployment.

## Key Achievements 🏆

- Successfully achieved a test accuracy of **97.57%** with the initial model implementation.
- Enhanced the model's performance by implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture, resulting in a remarkable test accuracy of **98.02%**.

## Suggestions for Further Enhancement 🚀

To further improve the project, the following recommendations can be considered:

- Implement a **Validation Set** during training to monitor accuracy at each epoch and prevent overfitting.
- Explore more advanced architectures like CNNs and experiment with different network architectures for even higher accuracy.
